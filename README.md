# Turbines Report

## A project using Laravel, ReactJS and MySQL


## The Task
A wind turbine has 100 items on it, each gets inspected. Write an application that outputs numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print “Coating Damage” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Lightning Strike” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “Coating Damage and Lightning Strike” instead of the number.

The MySQL database holds the details of a cluster of wind turbines. These details place markers on a Google Map. Clicking on a marker makes a call to calculate the report. The report is sent to the client with the turbine details and is displayed in a scrollable list with the turbine details above.
